\label{chapter:ir-spectra}

This chapter presents the infrared spectra obtained from ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations. Relationship between the IR spectrum and the structure of the liquid is analyzed and the results of calculations are compared to experimental data. Presented systems are some of those which structural properties were described in Chapter~\ref{chapter:structural-md} and one with unpublished results at the moment of writing this work.
