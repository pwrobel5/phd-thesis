\label{chapter:introduction}

This chapter presents the background to the matter of this thesis. It starts with a description of interactions through vibrational spectroscopy, and then proceeds to related experimental work on the topic of search for novel electrolytes for metal-ion batteries. Next, the current state of research in theoretical studies of such electrolytes and the computations of vibrational spectra from ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) are briefly described. Finally, the aim of the thesis is presented.
