\label{chapter:structural-md}

This chapter presents the structural data obtained for studied systems, focusing on the structure of complexes, coordination numbers calculated from RDFs and stability of interactions assessed through residence time autocorrelation functions, as defined in Section~\ref{subsection:structural-properties}.

Classical MD simulations were set-up and performed by one of co-authors of published papers, Dr. Piotr Kubisiak. The author of this Thesis contributed to the results of this chapter by conducting AIMD simulations, writing scripts and programs, and performing structural analysis of MD trajectories (classical and AIMD).
